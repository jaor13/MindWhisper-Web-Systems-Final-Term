							<p>As we emerge from the shadows of the pandemic, a silent yet pervasive epidemic is unfolding: mental health disorders. Globally, one in eight individuals grapples with mental health conditions, and the numbers are equally concerning in the Philippines. 41% of Filipino Prosumersâ€”those at the forefront of emerging trendsâ€”acknowledge their struggles with mental health. Among Filipino Gen-Zs, this figure soars to 73%, underscoring the urgency of addressing this issue.<br><br>But hereâ€™s the catch: stigma still shrouds mental health. Many suffer in silence, masking their true emotions to fit societal norms. The misguided belief that mental wellness is a mere choice perpetuates this silence. We must break down these barriers, fostering open dialogue and understanding.<br><br>Letâ€™s collectively pave the way forward. ðŸŒ± Organizations like Havas Ortega champion self-care and relaxation through initiatives like the TALK Initiative. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength. Letâ€™s embark on a journey toward better mental well-beingâ€”one conversation at a time.</p>
