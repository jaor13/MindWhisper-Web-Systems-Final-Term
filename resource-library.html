                                <p>Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional, or psychological strain. Stress is your body's response to anything that requires attention or action. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to your overall well-being. Remember that managing stress is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being.</p>

                                <p>Forgiveness is defined by replacing ill will toward an offender with goodwill. A 2023 study suggests forgiveness boosts mental health by reducing depression and anxiety levels. Other evidence suggests physical benefits as well. Studies indicate forgiveness also eases stress, improves sleep, and lowers blood pressure and heart rate. Being unable to forgive can raise blood pressure, which can affect overall heart health.</p>

                            <p>The science underpinning David Burns’s Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy may no longer be cutting edge, but its core message remains a powerfully relevant one. 
                                It is based on the premises of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Burns explains fundamental CBT principles clearly and convincingly, and provides numerous examples and anecdotes from his clinical practice to illustrate them. 
                                Feeling Good shows us how our feelings are shaped by our thoughts. It tells us we are not our thoughts — that we can distance ourselves from negative thoughts and learn to question their validity.</p>

                            <p>In The Happiness Trap, the doctor Russ Harris explains the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) — a third-wave cognitive behavioral intervention that also integrates insights from ancient wisdom practices. 
                                Harris invites us not to try to control our negative thoughts or uncomfortable feelings, nor to attempt to reason them away, but simply to de-fuse with them. 
                                He suggests we accept them and then try to let them go. So-called negative thoughts, Harris argues, are a natural part of being human. If we accept that we don’t always think happy thoughts and will also experience feelings such as sadness, anger, and shame occasionally, these thoughts and feelings will come and go more naturally.</p>

                            <p class="review-text" style="font-style: italic;">"This is a superb book. Laugh out loud funny, with brilliant examples and illustrations. It really does show children how to embrace the best of themselves for what they are, how to engage with the world in a confident and dynamic way, and how not to feel pressured into fitting in. Who would want to be boringly “normal” when you can be curious, kind, and awesome?!"</p>

                            <h2>Happy, Healthy Minds: A Children’s Guide to Emotional Wellbeing – The School of Life</h2>
                            <p>This exquisitely written and nicely illustrated book examines a range of different topics that children may experience as difficult.
                                Chapters include explorations of parents, friendship, school, anxiety, technology, first love, and emotions.
                                Described as an “atlas to a child’s mind,” Happy, Healthy Minds explores ideas about how children can cope with the vicissitudes of growing up.
                                Offering a sympathetic and supportive way of looking at ourselves and the world, it equips children with emotional intelligence and coping skills and makes them feel less alone with their problems.</p>

                            <p class="review-text" style="font-style: italic;">"I know this book is for children, but I, as an adult, benefited a lot while reading it. I think it is a great source for adults too to understand better ourselves and our problems--anger, disappointment, low confidence, etc--in the simplest way."</p>
